# Simulating Network Attacks then Detecting them using Wireshark


<h2>Project Details</h2>
This lab focuses on using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer, to simulate and detect various network attacks. The hands-on experience was designed to enhance my skills in network security analysis by providing a safe, pre-configured environment to practice detecting malicious activities.<br />
<br />

**Tasks Breakdown:**

**Task 1: Getting Started in the Lab Environment**

Started by initializing the lab environment, which involved setting up the necessary infrastructure. This foundational step ensures that all tools and applications, including Wireshark and the Attack Application, are ready for use.

**Task 2: Using the Attack Application: PS ATTACK ENGINE (Network TTPs)**

Learned how to use the Attack Application: PS ATTACK ENGINE (Network TTPs) to simulate different types of network attacks. This is crucial for generating the network traffic needed for analysis.

**Task 3: Capturing Packets with Wireshark**

Opened Wireshark and selected the appropriate network interface (ens5) to begin capturing live packets. This step is essential for monitoring network traffic in real-time.

**Task 4: Analyzing Network Attacks**

Analyzed and Categorized (Source, Destination, Protocol.. etc) the resulting traffic in Wireshark generated from the previous simulated attacks.

**Task 5: Reporting and Visualizing Findings**

Documented the findings from the packet analysis and created visual representations of the network traffic. This step is critical for summarizing insights and sharing them with relevant stakeholders.

<br />

**Key Takeaways:**

This lab enhanced my technical skills in using Wireshark for real-time network traffic analysis and detecting potential malicious activities. It provided practical experience in simulating network attacks and interpreting captured data, which is crucial for effective cybersecurity defense strategies. The ability to use Wireshark's powerful analysis tools prepares me for advanced network security monitoring and threat detection tasks.
