# Simulating Network Attacks then Detecting them using Wireshark


<h2>Project Details</h2>
Splunk (one of the most popular security information and event management (SIEM) platforms in the world) is a powerful tool used by cybersecurity professionals to monitor, search, and analyze machine-generated big data via a web-style interface. This lab focuses on understanding how to use Splunk for effective monitoring and detection of potential security threats.<br />
<br />

**Tasks Breakdown:**

**Task 1: Getting Started in the Lab Environment**

Started by initializing the lab environment which involved setting up the Splunk infrastructure. This foundational step is essential as it ensures all data ingestion and analysis can be performed efficiently.

**Task 2: Uploading Data to Splunk**

Learned how to upload various types of data to Splunk. This is crucial for ensuring that the data needed for analysis is correctly integrated into the system.

**Task 3: Performing Searches in Splunk**

Conducted searches within Splunk to locate specific information. Mastering search commands and understanding the syntax is vital for effective data analysis and threat detection.

**Task 4: Creating and Sharing Reports in Splunk**

Focused on creating and sharing reports. This involves summarizing findings and sharing insights with relevant stakeholders, which is critical for proactive threat management and response.

**Task 5: Creating Dashboards in Splunk**

Developed dashboards for continuous monitoring. Dashboards are essential for visualizing key metrics and real-time data to quickly assess and respond to threats.


<br />

**Key Takeaways:**

This lab enhanced my technical skills in using Splunk for real-time monitoring, detecting potential malicious activities, and complex data analysis. It also provided practical experience in managing and interpreting large datasets, which is crucial for effective cybersecurity defense strategies. The ability to customize and utilize Splunk's powerful searching and reporting tools prepares me for advanced cybersecurity monitoring and detection tasks.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Splunk Interface: Utilized for all data ingestion, searches, report generation, and dashboard creations.</b> 
  

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Splunk Environment: Conducted the project within Splunkâ€™s own operational environment, which is optimized for data analysis and monitoring tasks. This setup is essential for handling large-scale data specific to cybersecurity needs.

</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

**In this lab, I was acting as a security analyst that is using Splunk to review log data related to the company's web application (buttercupgames).**<br/><br/>

**In Task 1 & 2,** I opened Firefox and went to (http://172.31.24.10:8000), waited for Splunk to load, then logged in with the given credentials. After closing the pop-ups, I clicked Add data, chose Upload from your computer, and selected the tutorialdata.zip file from the lab folder. I set the Host to Segment in path with a value of 1, submitted the upload, and clicked Start Searching to access the data. <br/><br/>

**In Task 3,** I started by running a keyword search for buttercupgames error to find related messages. Then I enabled the clientip field to get more specific data and saw that the IP 87.194.216.51 had the most errors. I clicked on it to run a field-based search. After that, I switched the SPL Editor to Full mode in Preferences to see more detailed suggestions while typing. Finally, I ran a transformational search using sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | top categoryId to find the most common purchase categories.<br/><br/> 

**After that in Task 4,** I saved the previous transformational search by clicking Save as > Report, gave it the title Most popular categories with a description, and clicked Save. Then I viewed the report, edited the permissions to show it to the App and gave Everyone read access. After that, I went back to the search page, ran a new query for the top 10 client IPs, changed the time range to All time, clicked the Visualization tab, and switched the chart from bar to pie. <br/><br/>

**Finally in task 5,** I started by running a search for purchases using sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase, then added the fields date_mday, date_month, and itemId. After that, I ran a new search to find the most sold items by itemId, switched to the Visualization tab, and changed it to a Column Chart. I saved it to a new dashboard called Top Item Purchases. Then I ran another search for top date_mday, changed it to a Bar Chart, and added it to the same dashboard. Finally, I clicked View Dashboard to see both panels together.
